### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I've written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I've also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


###Statistics Computed
 The code will provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Software used
